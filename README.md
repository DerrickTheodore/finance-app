# MyFi

## Refactoring & Production-Readiness Checklist

### General Refactoring Suggestions

    No direct cross-package imports: Only use public APIs/exports and path aliases.
    No business logic in client or server that could be shared: Move to libs.
    No DB or API code in libs or client.
    No UI code outside client.
    Keep all migrations, schema, and DB utilities in infra.

- All shared types are in a single location (e.g., libs/types or @myfi/types).
- Path aliases are standardized and documented in root and per-package tsconfig.json.
- A root tsconfig.json is used for base config, and each package extends it.

### TypeScript Configuration

- Strictest TypeScript settings enabled (strict: true, noImplicitAny, etc.) in all packages.
- All files used across packages are included in the correct "include" arrays.
- All cross-package imports use paths aliases (no deep relative imports).

### API & Data Layer

- All API inputs and outputs are validated with a schema library (e.g., Zod).
- Error handling is centralized and endpoints return consistent error shapes.
- All DB access is through repositories/services, not directly in controllers/routes.
- List endpoints support pagination, filtering, and sorting.

### Server (API) Improvements

- Routes and controllers are modularized; no large files.
- Middleware is used for authentication, logging, and validation.
- Structured logger (e.g., pino, winston) is integrated for all server logs.
- Environment variable management and validation is handled (e.g., with dotenv or envsafe).
- Rate limiting and CORS configuration are in place.

### Client (Next.js) Improvements

- Components are organized by feature (feature folders).
- All data fetching and business logic is in hooks (e.g., useTransactions, useCategories).
- Error and loading UI is centralized for a consistent user experience.
- All interactive elements are accessible (labels, roles, keyboard navigation).
- Responsive design and mobile support are implemented.
- Consistent styling via CSS-in-JS or CSS modules.

### State Management

- React context or a state library (e.g., Zustand, Redux) is used for global state if needed.
- Prop drilling is avoided by using context or hooks.

### Testing

- Unit tests exist for all critical business logic in libs and server.
- Integration tests cover API endpoints and database interactions.
- E2E tests for user flows (e.g., Playwright or Cypress).
- CI runs all tests on every push/PR.

### Security & Production Readiness

- No secrets are committed; environment variables and secret managers are used.
- All user input is sanitized to prevent XSS/SQL injection.
- CSRF protection is enabled for all forms and API endpoints.
- Error and performance monitoring is integrated (e.g., Sentry).
- Proper CORS policies are set for the API.
- Rate limiting is enabled for public endpoints.

### DevOps & Deployment

- Dockerfiles exist for each service for consistent deployment.
- DB migrations are automated in deployment scripts.
- CI/CD is set up for linting, testing, and building.
- Health checks and readiness probes are configured for all services.

### Documentation

- README is updated with setup, usage, and deployment instructions.
- API is documented (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
- JSDoc/type comments are present for complex logic.
- All environment variables and configuration options are documented.

### UX & Feature Polish

- Loading spinners and error messages are present for all async actions.
- Confirmation dialogs exist for destructive actions (e.g., deleting accounts).
- User feedback is provided for successful actions (e.g., toast notifications).
- All forms have validation and helpful error messages.
